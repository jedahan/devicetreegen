Device Tree Fun
------------

The Beaglebone Black is an amazing device, but the device tree can be really annoying to work with sometimes. Lets generate one!

This was put together VERY quickly, and presently only supports GPIO 'mode7' --- testing, help and improvements are very welcome.

Components used:

* [Pin mappings](https://github.com/jadonk/bonescript/blob/master/src/bone.js) 
* [Device tree examples](https://github.com/jadonk/validation-scripts/tree/master/test-capemgr)
